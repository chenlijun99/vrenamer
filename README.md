# vrenamer

## Description
A mass video renamer based on the episode number
This is just a very rudimentary version of already existing mass renamers,
though it has been a nice exercise for me in bash scripting.

## Ideas
* Improve the option handling
* Add a --extension -e option to allow user to specify other extensions
* Make the script more smart... so vague
